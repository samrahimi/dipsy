# Orchestrator with inline subagent definitions
#
# This example shows how to define subagents directly in the same file
# rather than referencing separate YAML files. This is useful for simpler
# workflows where you want everything in one place.
#
# Run with:
#   python examples/conversational_agent_demo.py --agent examples/agents/orchestrator_inline.yaml

signature: "question -> answer"
model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

subagents:
  # Inline subagent definition - no separate file needed!
  - name: researcher
    description: "Delegate research and information-lookup questions to this agent. It can search for facts and general knowledge."
    agent:
      signature: "question -> answer"
      tools:
        - ../tools/search_tool.py

  # Another inline subagent
  - name: math_expert
    description: "Delegate math, arithmetic, and calculation questions to this agent. It can evaluate mathematical expressions."
    agent:
      signature: "question -> answer"
      tools:
        - ../tools/calculator_tool.py
      max_iters: 10  # Can customize settings per subagent

# You can also mix inline and file-based subagents in the same parent:
#
# subagents:
#   - name: researcher
#     description: "..."
#     agent: ./researcher.yaml        # External file
#
#   - name: math_expert
#     description: "..."
#     agent:                           # Inline definition
#       signature: "question -> answer"
#       tools:
#         - ../tools/calculator_tool.py
