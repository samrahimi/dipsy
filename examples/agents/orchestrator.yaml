# Orchestrator agent — delegates to specialist subagents.
#
# The orchestrator has no tools of its own. It routes questions to the
# appropriate subagent, each of which is a full ReAct agent with its
# own tools and conversation memory.
#
# Run with:
#   python examples/conversational_agent_demo.py --agent examples/agents/orchestrator.yaml
